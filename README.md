# autonom agents with SYCL (GPU) parallel 
- to compile must be instaled Raylib, Raygui and SYCL (tested on Windows with OneAPI and AdaptiveCpp on Linux)
- this repo is diploma working repos with "benchmarks" are without graphic, but still include raylib and raygui to compile must be set
- to run benchmark must be filled "saved_maps"
- to generate replace main.cpp from "final01" or from "linux_bin_benchmark" with main.cpp from "all/generate"
- files with codes in main folder are "only" experiments of principles SYCL
